# Balanced-IsoSpring
Balanced IsoSpring is a 2 DOF balanced oscillator implemented with flexure mechanisms. This project is dedicated to improve the actual mechanical watches with a new technology. We realized this work in the class of Simon Henein.

## Project
From the [brief of the project](projectbrief.pdf) we first designed 4 mechanisms ideas as [boards](planches). Which contains the ideal guiding with a Gr√ºbler analysis and its flexure mechanisms implementation. The 5th board is an overview with pros and cons of the ideas, showing why we selected the final mechanism.  
Nb: Due to a discussion with the teacher following the deadline of the boards, we choose another final solution that the one presented in the 5th board.

The final project is presented in its integrality in the file [Balanced-IsoSpring](Balanced-IsoSpring.pdf). We used CATIA to draw the technical schemes, based on the 3D design of the full mechanism we made in the software. The [full design file](IsoSpring-CATIA.stp) can be downloaded and extracted with CATIA V5 6R2018.
